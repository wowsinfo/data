In late 1942, work on Project X1 commenced—a ship with a displacement of 56,800 tons. The main disputes arose around the hangar, as previous ships were built with an entirely closed hangar. However, the U.S. aircraft carriers' operating experience showed that it's necessary to warm up aircraft engines in the hangar to carry out a massive launch of the air group. The choice fell on a project with an open hangar and two aircraft lifts on the port side.

年にイタリア軍によって占領され、イタリア軍は本艦を竣工させることを決定しました。そして 1943 年に本艦はスパラートと改称されて進水しました。しかしイタリアの降伏後、本艦は港内で座礁させられました。ユーゴスラビアは終戦後の 1948 年に本艦の建造作業を再開したものの、もはやチェコスロバキアから兵装を確保することはできなくなっていたため、最終的にはイギリスおよびアメリカの兵装を搭載する形で竣工しました。本艦は 1959 年に就役し、即座に海軍の旗艦になりました。", "IDS_PWSD208_YEAR": "1958", "IDS_PWUA703_D8_ART_STOCK": "140 mm/56 Skoda
